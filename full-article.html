          In a world of confusing diet trends and restrictive meal plans, finding a sustainable approach to healthy eating can feel overwhelming. At Light Bites & Bright Moments, we believe wellness shouldn't mean sacrifice—instead, it's about making informed choices that nourish your body while satisfying your taste buds.
        </p>

        <h2>The Science of Light Eats</h2>
        <p>
          "Light" doesn't mean skimping on flavor or nutrition—it refers to meals that deliver maximum nutritional value with balanced calorie counts. Our approach is rooted in three principles:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Nutrient Density</strong>: Prioritizing foods rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber relative to their calorie content.</li>
          <li><strong>Macronutrient Balance</strong>: Combining protein, healthy fats, and complex carbs to keep you full and energized.</li>
          <li><strong>Portion Awareness</strong>: Understanding serving sizes without obsessive counting.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Why Visualization Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Studies show that people are more likely to stick to healthy habits when they can <em>see</em> what they're eating. Our visualized recipes bridge the gap between intention and action by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Removing guesswork from ingredient quantities</li>
          <li>Showing exactly what "done" looks like at each cooking step</li>
          <li>Making nutrition data easy to understand with visual charts</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="article-quote">
          "Healthy eating isn't about perfection—it's about consistency. Small, sustainable changes lead to lasting results."
        </div>
